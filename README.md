Final Project - My Medication Tracker

GOAL: 
My application is based around my personal need to keep track of the medicines I take on a daily basis. My goal for the application is to provide a users the ability to manage personal medications. 

DESIGN:
The following is the prelimiary design mock up used for development and is provided below as a reference to represent the design process and the overall flow of the website described in the "function section". 




FUNCTION: 
The site functions with the users ability to first sign in or create an account (1 & 2). Once signed/logged in, the user is able to view their list of medications with an option to add a new medication (3). If the user chooses to add a new medication, they are routed to a page to search for a valid FDA medicaiton to add (4) (using an external API validation database). Once the user is successful in finding a valid medication, they are sent to a page where they can add further details about the new medication (5). Upon submission, they are then rerouted back to the user dashboard (3) where they can either add a new medication OR edit an existing one. If they choose to do the latter, they are prompted with instruction to click on a medication to see details. Upon doing so, they are presented with a page with the chosen medication's details, which they are then able to either update the information (7), or delete the medication all together (6). Either option will then reroute the user to the dashboard once more. 

as have the option to check medication interactions between new and existing medications (future development).
